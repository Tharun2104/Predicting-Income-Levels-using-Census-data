# Predicting-Income-Levels-using-Census-data

This project analyzes census data (Adult dataset) to predict whether individuals earn more than $50K annually using machine learning. The dataset includes demographic and employment-related features, making it a popular benchmark for income classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Adult" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview
1. **Preprocessing:** 
   - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize/scale numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Age distribution and income distribution by gender.
  
3. **Visualization:**
   - Various bar charts and distribution plots to help understand the data.

4. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Applied classifiers such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression to predict income levels.
   - Achieved >85% accuracy using Random Classifier.
